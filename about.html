<p>My name is Daniel Ward, and I'm a DevOps engineer with a passion for exploring new ways of interacting any type of software and hardware can come my way.</p>

<p>I'm highly interested in hosting platforms and and tools like <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a>, <a href="http://docker.io/">Docker</a>, <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a>, <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a> and <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">Lambda</a>. <a href="http://arduino.cc/">Arduino</a>, <a href="http://raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>, <a href="http://www.rtl-sdr.com/">RTL-SDR</a>, <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/13678">ESP8266</a> and what ever else I can convince my wife to let me buy take up a large part of my spare time.</p>

<p>I'm known and respected for my troubleshooting and quick thinking in any emergency situation and take pride in being the "go to" guy for just about anything you tech related you can think of.</p>

<p>I welcome you to take a look through my blog posts for some more insight.</p>
